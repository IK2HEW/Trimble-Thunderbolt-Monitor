This is a hardware and software project to monitor and command a Trimble Thunderbolt which is a GPS disciplined 10MHz reference.

The software runs on a Netduino which is a .net version of the popular Arduino platform.  It also includes a shield to make connecting it up to the Netduino much cleaner.  I have designed the shield to be compatible with both Netduino and Arduino in case someone wants to port to the other platform.

This particular version requires a Netduino Plus but can be recompiled for other Netduino models.  The reason I have started with the Plus edition is I plan to add network functionality to it.

It is important to note that it also requires .NET Micro Framework 4.2 at present.
